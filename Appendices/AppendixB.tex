A customized carousel was built by me for the main poage of the exhibit to implement the design that we had created. The carousel was created using the help of a library called React-Slick, which is a slider library that also let's you customize it's parameter's through javascript, and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). 
For the website to be as the client wanted i.e to be accessible by any age groups, a lot of thought went into how the inputs would affect the slider, and how it would scale in different devices. Below is an example of the Carousel component built using React with dummy data.

Below is the custom CSS used for the aove React component
