As every project starts with a goal to establish, a problem to solve and to make existing
projects better, they all lead to a result. These results helps us to determine whether the
approach taken, job done, analysis and research conducted was correct and up to the
mark or not. These results then help us to conclude what we have gained from all the
hassle of researching, developing and testing.
